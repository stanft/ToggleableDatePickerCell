# ToggleableDatePickerCell

Inline/expandable date picker for iOS table views. This component is based on the `DatePickerCell` by Dylan Vann 
(see https://github.com/DylanVann/DatePickerCell) but has been reimplemented based on iOS 9. In addition, the component
now supports the enabling/disabling of the date input so that it is possible to allow the user to choose whether
a date input is appropiate or not.

## Installation

The component can be added using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Just add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ToggleableDatePickerCell', :inhibit_warnings => true, :git => 'https://github.com/stanft/ToggleableDatePickerCell', :tag => '0.5.0'
```

## Usage

The usage of the component is shown in the supplied example project.
